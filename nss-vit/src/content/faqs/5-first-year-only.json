  "question": "Can only first-year students join NSS?",
  "answer": "NSS VIT accepts only first-year students at the end of their academic year. This allows the students to fulfill the requirement of participating in NSS for 2 academic years and ensures they don't have to juggle NSS activities with the demands of their final year. However, anyone who wants to join in for the events willingly is always welcome.",
